# Project: Decoder Ring

> You're planning a surprise birthday party for one of your friends who _loves_ escape rooms and puzzles. What better way to practice your new coding skills than to build an application that will help you encode and decode all kinds of fun messages?

This project is designed to test your ability to build complex algorithms as well as write unit tests with Mocha & Chai to test your algorithms. Before taking on this module, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below. You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

## Learning Objectives

This project will assess the following key learning objectives:

- Write a series of unit tests using Mocha & Chai.
- Use different `expect()` methods to test your code.
  
## Instructions

You are tasked with building functions for an application that will either encode or decode a string using a variety of ciphers. For each cipher, you should make a series of tests using Mocha & Chai to confirm that your cipher works.

All of the functions can be found inside of the `src/` directory, and the corresponding test files can be found in `tests/`. Each function and cipher is described below.

Below is a checklist of what you need to accomplish.

- [ ] Complete the `caesar()` function.
- [ ] Write tests for the `caesar()` function.
- [ ] Complete the `polybius()` function.
- [ ] Write tests for the `polybius()` function.
- [ ] Complete the `substitution()` function.
- [ ] Write tests for the `substitution()` function.
